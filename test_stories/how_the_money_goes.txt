HOW THE MONEY GOES

BY JOHN G. SAXE


  How goes the Money?--Well,
  I'm sure it isn't hard to tell;
  It goes for rent, and water-rates,
  For bread and butter, coal and grates,
  Hats, caps, and carpets, hoops and hose,--
  And that's the way the Money goes!

  How goes the Money?--Nay,
  Don't everybody know the way?
  It goes for bonnets, coats and capes,
  Silks, satins, muslins, velvets, crapes,
  Shawls, ribbons, furs, and furbelows,--
  And that's the way the Money goes!

  How goes the Money?--Sure,
  I wish the ways were something fewer;
  It goes for wages, taxes, debts;
  It goes for presents, goes for bets,
  For paint, _pommade_, and _eau de rose_,--
  And that's the way the Money goes!

  How goes the Money?--Now,
  I've scarce begun to mention how;
  It goes for laces, feathers, rings,
  Toys, dolls--and other baby-things,
  Whips, whistles, candies, bells and bows,--
  And that's the way the Money goes!

  How goes the Money?--Come,
  I know it doesn't go for rum;
  It goes for schools and sabbath chimes,
  It goes for charity--sometimes;
  For missions, and such things as those,--
  And that's the way the Money goes!

  How goes the Money?--There!
  I'm out of patience, I declare;
  It goes for plays, and diamond pins,
  For public alms, and private sins,
  For hollow shams, and silly shows,--
  And that's the way the Money goes!
