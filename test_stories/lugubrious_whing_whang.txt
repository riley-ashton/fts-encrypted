THE LUGUBRIOUS WHING-WHANG

BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY


  The rhyme o' The Raggedy Man's 'at's best
    Is Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs,--
  'Cause that-un's the strangest of all o' the rest,
  An' the worst to learn, an' the last one guessed,
  An' the funniest one, an' the foolishest.--
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!

  I don't know what in the world it means--
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!--
  An' nen when I _tell_ him I don't, he leans
  Like he was a-grindin' on some machines
  An' says: Ef I _don't_, w'y, I don't know _beans_!
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!

  Out on the margin of Moonshine Land,
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!
  Out where the Whing-Whang loves to stand,
  Writing his name with his tail in the sand,
  And swiping it out with his oogerish hand;
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!

  Is it the gibber of Gungs or Keeks?
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!
  Or what _is_ the sound that the Whing-Whang seeks?
  Crouching low by the winding creeks
  And holding his breath for weeks and weeks!
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!

  Anoint him, the wraithest of wraithly things!
    Tickle me, Love, in these Lonesome Ribs!
  'Tis a fair Whing-Whangess, with phosphor rings,
  And bridal-jewels of fangs and stings;
  And she sits and as sadly and softly sings
  As the mildewed whir of her own dead wings,--
    Tickle me, Dear,
      Tickle me here,
    Tickle me, Love, in me Lonesome Ribs!
