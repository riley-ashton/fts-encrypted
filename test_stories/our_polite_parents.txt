OUR POLITE PARENTS

BY CAROLYN WELLS


SEDATE MAMMA

  When guests were present, dear little Mabel
  Climbed right up on the dinner-table
  And naughtily stood upon her head!
  "I wouldn't do that, dear," Mamma said.


  MERRY MOSES

  Merry, funny little Moses
  Burnt off both his brothers' noses;
  And it made them look so queer
  Mamma said, "Why, Moses, dear!"


  JOHNNY'S FUN

  Johnny climbed up on the bed,
  And hammered nails in Mamma's head.
  Though the child was much elated,
  Mamma felt quite irritated.

  A MERRY GAME

  Betty and Belinda Ames
  Had the pleasantest of games;
  'Twas to hide from one another
  Marmaduke, their baby brother.

  Once Belinda, little love,
  Hid the baby in the stove;
  Such a joke! for little Bet
  Hasn't found the baby yet.


  TOM AND GRANDPA

  From his toes up to his shins
  Tom stuck Grandpa full of pins;
  Although Tom the fun enjoyed,
  Grandpapa was quite annoyed.


  BABY'S LOOKS

  Bobby with the nursery shears
  Cut off both the baby's ears;
  At the baby, so unsightly,
  Mamma raised her eyebrows slightly.


  JEANETTE'S PRANKS

  One night, Jeanette, a roguish little lass,
  Sneaked in the guest room and turned on the gas;
  When morning dawned the guest was dead in bed,
  But "Children will be children," Mamma said.
