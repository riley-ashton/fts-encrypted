A CAVALIER'S VALENTINE

(1644)

BY CLINTON SCOLLARD


  The sky was like a mountain mere,
    The lilac buds were brown,
  What time a war-worn cavalier
    Rode into Taunton-town.
  He sighed and shook his head forlorn;
    "A sorry lot is mine,"
  He said, "who have this merry morn
    Pale Want for Valentine."

  His eyes, like heather-bells at dawn,
    Were blue and brave and bold;
  Against his cheeks, now wan and drawn,
    His love-locks tossed their gold.
  And as he rode, beyond a wall
    With ivy overrun,
  His glance upon a maid did fall,
    A-sewing in the sun.

  As sweet was she as wilding thyme,
    A boon, a bliss, a grace:
  It made the heart blood beat in rhyme
    To look upon her face.
  He bowed him low in courtesy,
    To her deep marvelling;
  "Fair Mistress Puritan," said he,
    "It is forward spring."

  As when the sea-shell flush of morn
    Throws night in rose eclipse,
  So sunshine smiles, that instant born,
    Brought brightness to her lips;
  Her voice was modest, yet, forsooth,
    It had a roguish ring;
  "_You_, sir, of all should know that truth--
    It _is_ a forward spring!"
