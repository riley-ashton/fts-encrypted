A BALLADE OF PING-PONG

BY ALDEN CHARLES NOBLE


  She wears a rosebud in her hair
    To mock me as it tosses free;
  Were I more wise and she less fair
    I fear that I should never be
    A victim to such witchery;
  For at her wiles and lovely arts
    I'm fain to laugh with her, while she
  Plays ping-pong with my heart of hearts.

  The play's the thing; I wonder where,
    What courtier with what courtesy
  First played it, with what lady fair,
    To music of what minstrelsy?
    I wonder did he seem to see
  Such eyes wherein a sunbeam starts,
    And did he love (as I) while she
  Played ping-pong with his heart of hearts?

  For battledore they called it, there
    In courts of gilded chivalry;
  No gallant ever lived to dare
    To doubt its airy potency;
    But now, that all the pageantry
  Of those dead emperors departs,
    I dream that she in memory
  Plays ping-pong with my heart of hearts.
