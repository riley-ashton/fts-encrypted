WHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE

BY S. E. KISER


  He looked at my tongue and he shook his head--
    This was Doctor Smart--
  He thumped on my chest, and then he said:
    "Ah, there it is! Your heart!
    You mustn't run--you mustn't hurry!
    You mustn't work--you mustn't worry!
  Just sit down and take it cool;
    You may live for years, I can not say;
  But, in the meantime, make it a rule
    To take this medicine twice a day!"

  He looked at my tongue, and he shook his head--
    This was Doctor Wise--
  "Your liver's a total wreck," he said,
    "You must take more exercise!
    You mustn't eat sweets.
    You mustn't eat meats,
  You must walk and leap, you must also run;
    You mustn't sit down in the dull old way;
  Get out with the boys and have some fun--
    And take three doses of this a day!"

  He looked at my tongue, and he shook his head--
    This was Doctor Bright--
  "I'm afraid your lungs are gone," he said,
    "And your kidney isn't right.
    A change of scene is what you need,
    Your case is desperate, indeed,
  And bread is a thing you mustn't eat--
    Too much starch--but, by the way,
  You must henceforth live on only meat--
    And take six doses of this a day!"

  Perhaps they were right, and perhaps they knew,
    It isn't for me to say;
  Mayhap I erred when I madly threw
    Their bitter stuff away;
    But I'm living yet and I'm on my feet,
    And grass isn't all I dare to eat,
  And I walk and I run and I worry, too,
    But, to save my life, I can not see
  What some of the able doctors would do
    If there were no fools like you and me.
