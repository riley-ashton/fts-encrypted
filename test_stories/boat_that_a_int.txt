THE BOAT THAT AIN'T[4]

BY WALLACE IRWIN


  A stout, fat boat for gailin'
    And a long, slim boat for squall;
  But there isn't no fun in sailin'
    When you haven't no boat at all.

  For what is the use o' calkin'
    A tub with a mustard pot--
  And what is the use o' talkin'
    Of a boat that you haven't got?
