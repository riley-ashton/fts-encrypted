THE NINE LITTLE GOBLINS

BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY


  They all climbed up on a high board-fence--
    Nine little Goblins, with green-glass eyes--
  Nine little Goblins that had no sense,
    And couldn't tell coppers from cold mince pies;
      And they all climbed up on the fence, and sat--
      And I asked them what they were staring at.

  And the first one said, as he scratched his head
    With a queer little arm that reached out of his ear
  And rasped its claws in his hair so red--
    "This is what this little arm is fer!"
      And he scratched and stared, and the next one said
      "How on earth do _you_ scratch your head?"

  And he laughed like the screech of a rusty hinge--
    Laughed and laughed till his face grew black;
  And when he choked, with a final twinge
    Of his stifling laughter, he thumped his back
      With a fist that grew on the end of his tail
      Till the breath came back to his lips so pale.

  And the third little Goblin leered round at me--
    And there were no lids on his eyes at all--
  And he clucked one eye, and he says, says he,
    "What is the style of your socks this fall?"
      And he clapped his heels--and I sighed to see
      That he had hands where his feet should be.

  Then a bald-faced Goblin, gray and grim,
    Bowed his head, and I saw him slip
  His eyebrows off, as I looked at him,
    And paste them over his upper lip;
      And then he moaned in remorseful pain--
      "Would--Ah, would I'd me brows again!"

  And then the whole of the Goblin band
    Rocked on the fence-top to and fro,
  And clung, in a long row, hand in hand,
    Singing the songs that they used to know--
      Singing the songs that their grandsires sung
      In the goo-goo days of the Goblin-tongue.

  And ever they kept their green-glass eyes
    Fixed on me with a stony stare--
  Till my own grew glazed with a dread surmise,
    And my hat whooped up on my lifted hair,
      And I felt the heart in my breast snap to
      As you've heard the lid of a snuff-box do.

  And they sang, "You're asleep! There is no board-fence,
    And never a Goblin with green-glass eyes!--
  'Tis only a vision the mind invents
    After a supper of cold mince-pies,--
      And you're doomed to dream this way," they said,--
      "_And you sha'n't wake up till you're clean plum dead!_"
