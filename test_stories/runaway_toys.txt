THE RUNAWAY TOYS

BY FRANK L. STANTON


  The Hobby Horse was so tired that day,
    With never a bite to eat,
  That he whispered the Doll: "I shall run away!"
    And he galloped out to the street
  With the curly-headed Doll Baby on his back;
  And hard at his heels went the Jumping Jack!
  And the little boy--he never knew,
  Though the little Steam Engine blew and blew!

  Then the Humming Top went round and round,
    And crashed through the window-pane,
  And the scared Tin Monkey made a bound
    For the little red Railroad Train.
  The painted Duck went "Quack! quack! quack!"
  But the Railroad Train just whistled back!
  Till the Elephant saw what the racket meant
  And packed his trunk and--away he went!

  The little Toy Sheep in the corner there
    Was bleating long and loud;
  But the Parrot said "Hush!" and pulled his hair,
    And he galloped off with the crowd!
  And the Tin Horn blew and the Toy Drum beat,
  But away they went down the frightened street,
  Till they all caught up with the Railroad Train,
  And they never went back to their homes again!

  The blue policeman and all the boys
    Went racing away--away!
  For a big reward for the runaway Toys
    Was cried in the streets that day.
  But they kept right on round the world so wide,
  While the Little Boy stood on the steps and cried.
  Where did they go to, and what did they do?
  Bored a hole to China and--dropped through!
