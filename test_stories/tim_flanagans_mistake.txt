TIM FLANAGAN'S MISTAKE

BY WALLACE BRUCE AMSBARY


  Dat Irishman named Flanagan,
    He's often joke wid me,
  He leeve here now mos' twanty year,
    Ver' close to Kankakee;
  I always look for chance to gat
    An' even op wid heem,
  But he's too smart, exception wance,
    Dis Irishman named Tim.

  Wan Sunday tam' I'm walking out
    I meet Tim on de knoll,
  We bot' are hav' a promenade
    An' mak' a leddle stroll;
  We look down from de top of hill,
    An' on de reevere's edge
  Is w'at you call a heifer calf,--
    He stan' dere by de hedge.

  Dat calf stan' still an' wag hees tail
    On eas' an' den wes' side,
  An' den he wag it to de sout'
    For whip flies off hees hide;
  I say to Tim dat heifer calf
    Dat stan' so quiet still,
  You can not push him on de stream;
    He say, "By gosh, I will."

  An' den he grin an' smile out loud,
      He fall opon de groun',
  An' den he laugh wance mor' again
    An' roll de place aroun':
  He say, 'twill be a ver' good joke
    Opon dat heifer calf,
  An' wance mor' he start op h'right quick
    An' mak' de beeg horse laugh.

  Says Tim, "You watch me now, ma frien',
    I'll geeve dat calf wan scare,
  I will rone down an' push him quick
    On Kankakee Reevere."
  An' he laugh out a beeg lot mor',
    Den he t'row off hees hat,
  An' start down hill two-forty gait,
    He fly as swif' as bat.

  Dat calf he stan' an' wag hees tail
    For 'bout two t'ree tam' mor';
  W'en Tim com' ronnin' down de hill
    She move two yard down shore;
  But Tim now com' lak' cannon ball,
    He can't turn right nor lef',
  He miss de calf an' den, by gosh!
    Fall on reevere himse'f.

  Dose Sunday close dat Tim had on
    He wet dem t'roo an' t'roo,
  An' w'en he pick himse'f op slow
    An' walk heem out de sloo,
  He say, "Dat's good I mak' a laugh
    Before I tak' dat fall;
  I laugh not den, I hav' no fone
    Out of dis t'ing at all."
