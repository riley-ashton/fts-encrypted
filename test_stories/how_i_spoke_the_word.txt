HOW I SPOKE THE WORD

FRANK L. STANTON


  The snow come down in sheets of white
    An' made the pine trees shiver;
  'Peared like the world had said good night
    An' crawled beneath the kiver.

  The river's shiny trail wuz gone--
    The winds sung out a warnin';
  The mountains put their nightcaps on
    An' said: "Good-by till mornin'!"

  'Twuz jest the night in fiel' an' wood
    When cabin homes look cozy,
  An' fine oak fires feel mighty good,
    An' women's cheeks look rosy.

  An' that remin's me. We wuz four,
    A-settin' by the fire;
  But still it 'peared ten mile or more
    Betwixt me an' Maria!

  "No, sir!" (I caught that eye of his,
    An' then I fit and floundered!)
  "The thing I want to tell you is--"
    Says he: "The old mare's _foundered_?"

  "No, sir! it ain't about no hoss!"
    (My throat begin to rattle!)
  "I see," he said, "another loss
    In them fine Jersey cattle!"

  An' then I lost my patience! Then
    I hollered high and higher
  (You could 'a' heard me down the glen):
    "_No, sir! I want Maria!_"

  "An' now," says I, "the shaft'll strike:
    He'll let _that_ statement stay so!"
  He looked at me astonished-like,
    Then yelled: "_Why didn't you say so?_"
