"HULLO!"

BY SAM WALTER FOSS


  W'en you see a man in woe,
  Walk right up and say "hullo!"
  Say "hullo," an' "how d'ye do!"
  "How's the world a usin' you?"
  Slap the fellow on his back,
  Bring your han' down with a whack;
  Waltz right up, an' don't go slow,
  Grin an' shake an' say "hullo!"

  Is he clothed in rags? O sho!
  Walk right up an' say "hullo!"
  Rags is but a cotton roll
  Jest for wrappin' up a soul;
  An' a soul is worth a true
  Hale an' hearty "how d'ye do!"
  Don't wait for the crowd to go,
  Walk right up an' say "hullo!"

  W'en big vessels meet, they say,
  They saloot an' sail away.
  Jest the same are you an' me,
  Lonesome ships upon a sea;
  Each one sailing his own jog
  For a port beyond the fog.
  Let your speakin' trumpet blow,
  Lift your horn an' cry "hullo!"

  Say "hullo," an' "how d'ye do!"
  Other folks are good as you.
  W'en you leave your house of clay,
  Wanderin' in the Far-Away,
  W'en you travel through the strange
  Country t'other side the range,
  Then the souls you've cheered will know
  Who you be, an' say "hullo!"
